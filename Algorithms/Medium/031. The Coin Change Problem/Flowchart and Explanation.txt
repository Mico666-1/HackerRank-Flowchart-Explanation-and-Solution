The getWays function calculates the total number of ways to make change for an amount n using the coins in list c. It uses dynamic programming where dp[i] stores the number of ways to form amount i. Starting with dp[0] = 1, it iterates through each coin and updates all amounts greater than or equal to that coinâ€™s value by adding dp[i - coin] to dp[i]. The final result dp[n] gives the total number of combinations possible.
