 v
Read grid dimensions n and m

 v
Store all valid pluses in list

 v
For each cell in grid

Expand plus size while valid and add to list

For each pair of pluses

The algorithm identifies all possible plus shapes made of 'G' cells, checks every pair for overlap, and calculates the product of their areas. The maximum non-overlapping area product is the final result.
