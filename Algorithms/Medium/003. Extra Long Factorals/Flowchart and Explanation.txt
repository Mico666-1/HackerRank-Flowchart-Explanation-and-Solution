The program calculates the factorial of a large number n. Since factorial values grow extremely fast, normal integer types cannot hold such large results. To handle this, the program uses C#â€™s BigInteger type from the System.Numerics namespace, which supports arbitrary large integers. The algorithm multiplies all integers from 2 up to n and then prints the final product as the factorial result.
