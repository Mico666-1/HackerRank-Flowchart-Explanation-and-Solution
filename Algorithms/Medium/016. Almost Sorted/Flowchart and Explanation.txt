 v
Read array arr

 v
Create sorted copy of arr
 |
 v
Find indices where arr[i] != sorted[i]
 |
 v
If no differences → Print "yes"
 |
 v
Else if two differences → Print "yes" and swap indices

 v
Else reverse subarray between first and last difference

 v
If reversed array equals sorted → Print "yes" and reverse indices

Else → Print "no"

The algorithm checks whether the array can be sorted by a single swap or reverse operation. It compares the array with its sorted version, identifies mismatched positions, and verifies if performing one of these operations results in a sorted array.
