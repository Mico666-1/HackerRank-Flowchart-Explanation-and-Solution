The problem asks for the size of the largest subset where the sum of any two numbers is not divisible by k.
The approach uses modular arithmetic: numbers with the same remainder modulo k cannot coexist with their complementary remainders (those that add up to k).
The program counts how many numbers have each remainder and, for every pair (i, kâˆ’i), only the more frequent remainder group is included.
Special cases handled:

    * Only one number with remainder 0 can be chosen.
    * If k is even, only one number with remainder k/2 can be chosen.
