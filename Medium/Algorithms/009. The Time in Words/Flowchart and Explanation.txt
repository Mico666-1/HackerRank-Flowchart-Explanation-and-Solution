The function converts a given time (in hours and minutes) into its spoken English form.
If m == 0, it outputs “X o’ clock.”
For m == 15, m == 30, and m == 45, it returns “quarter past,” “half past,” and “quarter to” respectively.
For values less than 30, it says “minutes past hour.”
For values greater than 30, it calculates 60 - m and says “minutes to next hour.”
The numbers array maps integers to their word equivalents.
