The algorithm calculates the total number of balls in each container and the total number of each ball type. By sorting these totals and comparing them, it checks if there’s a one-to-one match between container capacities and ball type quantities. If they match, it’s possible to organize all balls so that each container holds only one type; otherwise, it’s impossible.
